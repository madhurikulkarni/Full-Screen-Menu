Full screen Overlay Navigation

One current trend in navigation styles that you may have seen is the full screen navigation overlay. With this type of navigation, toggling the navigation will overlay the menu across the entire screen.

The main idea would be to use only CSS and not have JS involved in this menu and the easiest way would be to have a checkbox that can be used to toggle in/out the menu.

```
<input type="checkbox" id="op" autocomplete="off">
```
